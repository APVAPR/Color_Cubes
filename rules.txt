The goal of the game is to have no colored cubes left on the board.
When you click on a cube, all adjacent cubes of the same color are burned.
If there are no cubes of the same color next to the pressed cube, it does not burn.
The more cubes you burn at once, the more points you get.
The game ends with a loss if only one cube of the same color remains on the field or there are no adjacent cubes of the same color on the field
